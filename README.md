# Primary School Library Management System Frontend
## Description
Through the Primary School Library management systems, librarians can keep track of the books and their checkouts, as well as members’ profiles. The Primary School Library management systems also involve maintaining the database for entering new books and recording books that have been borrowed with their respective due dates. The library system also provides an easy way to register user accounts, user accounts can be registered using csv files and normal form registrations.

# Instructions
1. Install docker and run "docker-compose up --build -d"
2. Using a MySQL Client, connect to the database via localhost:3306, username = root, password = password
Create a database named "fyp_primary_school_management"
3. Re-build the docker images using the command "docker-compose up --build -d"
4. All of the database fields should be auto generated by Sequelize
5. Setup the database fields(refer to #1)
6. The client web application is started at http://localhost:3000


## Setup the database fields:
1. Go to the backend folder, run all the SQL command available in the "createData.sql"
2. Insert the following command to the MySQL client
```
	USE "fyp_primary_school_management";
	INSERT INTO role (id, role) VALUES (1, 'admin'), (2, 'student'), (3, 'librarian'), (4, 'teacher');

	ALTER TABLE book AUTO_INCREMENT = 1001;
	ALTER TABLE book_detail AUTO_INCREMENT = 1001;

	ALTER TABLE BOOK_DETAIL ADD COLUMN barcode_path varchar(255);
```
3. Add one data into the settings table.
